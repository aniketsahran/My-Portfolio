            I am an enthusiastic learner seeking to work with an organization which provides opportunities to apply and enhance oneâ€™s skill set, be it technical or non-technical, in exchange for a solid work ethic, integrity and commitment to superior performance.
            I have worked on a wide variety of projects that have allowed me to put what I've learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense.
            My biggest strengths are my consistency and my coolheaded approach to the challenges.
            As a part of a prestigious institution, I acknowledge as many opportunities as one can.
            I pride myself on being detail-oriented, analytical, and driven.
